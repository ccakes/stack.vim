INTRODUCTION						*stack*

This plugin provides a simple but efficient auto-window layout that adjusts
to your session dimensions (terminal or window) and updates as you add/remove
your splits.

I tended to find myself always needing to fiddle with split sizing after
creating new windows. This looks at the available real estate and attempts to
make intelligent decisions for you. It's based heavily on dwm.vim and more
traditional tiling window managers.

MAPPINGS						*stack-mappings*

<C-n>		Create new split
<C-c>		Close current window (unless last)
<C-l>		Switch current window with master
